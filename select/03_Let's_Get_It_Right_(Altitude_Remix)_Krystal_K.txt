Transcribed by: Azzdem & Wilderness Girl
CHORUS
I've been waiting much too long
For me and you to get it on
Let's get it on baby
I've been waiting much too long
For me and you to get it on
Let's get it on baby
Get on get on
Used to be sunshine on one cloudy days
And you took your life and love and then you went astray
Used to give me all your love and then you hold me tight
I can tease you all you want in the middle of the night
Me say back up hold on slow down wait a minute
You cannot? loving if your heart's not in it
But a you then love there aren't no other
Cause when I get a hurt I need another lover
CHORUS
Been waiting too long for a love that's true
I never need another love one make her brand new?
Treat them nice and treat them right and holding me tight
Sex me and caress me in the middle of the night
Me say back up hold on slow down wait a minute
You cannot? loving if your heart's not in it
Cause in a me heart in a me Snow my loving is strong
Now I'm searching for the lady with the red dress on
CHORUS
Used to be sunshine on one cloudy days
And you took your life and love and then you went astray
Used to give me all your love and then you hold me tight
I can tease you all you want in the middle of the night (hear this)
Listen for me, now listen for me
Have a lock that's in your heart
Now won't you give me the key
It's you that I need
Been waiting too long
So it's nice that Daddy me Snow me I fi carry on
CHORUS
